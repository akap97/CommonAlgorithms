# CommonAlgorithms


#### 1) fibo_sum_lastDigit: Given an integer n, find the last digit of the sum F0 + F1 + · · · + Fn .

#### 2) fibo(n)mod(m): Given two integers n and m, output Fn mod m (that is, the remainder of Fn when divided by m).

#### 3) euclidean: Given two integers a and b, find their greatest common divisor.

#### 4) LineSweep: You are given a set of points on a line and a set of segments on a line. The goal is to compute, for each point, the number of segments that contain this point.

#### 5) LCM: Given two integers a and b, find their least common multiple.
